#### Version-tracking and collaboration

If you're working in a team of more than 1 person, you may want to consider tracking your `./metaframe/metadata` directory through git rather than locally through your own computer. To set this up, navigate to `~/.metaframe/metadata`, run `git init`, and proceed as usual with any other repo. Voila, you now have version-tracked metadata!

You can now set up a CI/CD pipeline or airflow to manage your ETL job for you.
