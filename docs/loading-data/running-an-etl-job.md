# Running an ETL job

Once your connection is set up, you can trigger a full ETL job by running:

```text
mf etl
```

For most databases, this can take quite some time \(often several hours\).

If you're using a [Custom ETL](custom-etl.md) job, you simply need to run that job in your local environment.
