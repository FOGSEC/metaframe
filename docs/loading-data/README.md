Currently, metaframe supports the following connections out-of-the-box:

* presto
* neo4j \(amundsen's format\) _\[WIP\]_

If you need to connect any other sort of database, it's not difficult -- you just have to make your own amundsen pipeline. See [Custom ETL](custom-etl.md) for detailed instructions.

If you'd like us to build native support for your connection, drop an issue, and I'd be happy to oblige. \(Or feel free to make a contribution! It's not difficult!\)
